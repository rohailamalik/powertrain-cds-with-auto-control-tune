# Simulation-driven Computational Synthesis of Vehicle Powertrain Topologies with integrated autonomous control tuning

This MATLAB-based framework autonomously designs, models, auto-control tunes, and simulates possible vehicle powertrain architectures. It is limited to a specific set of components from the library and can only generate sequential layouts (where components are arranged in a sequence/line).

## Additional Files Included
- **Powertrain_Library_GenAI.slx**: The Simulink library used by the framework.
- **parameters_database.mat**: A collection of sets of parameters for powertrain components in the library.
- **WLTP and NYC Cycles**: Provided with this code for performance evaluation.

## Usage
1. Open the `main.mlx` live script.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the script to run the framework.

### Editing Parameters
Check the guide on the parameters database text file if you wish to edit the parameters.
